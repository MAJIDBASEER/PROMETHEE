Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations

The Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations and its descriptive complement geometrical analysis for interactive aid are better known as the Promethee and Gaia methods.
Rather than pointing out a "right" decision, the Promethee and Gaia method helps decision makers find the alternative that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, identifying and quantifying its conflicts and synergies, clusters of actions, and highlight the main alternatives and the structured reasoning behind.The basic elements of the Promethee method have been first introduced by Professor Jean-Pierre Brans (CSOO, VUB Vrije Universiteit Brussel) in 1982.It was later developed and implemented by Professor Jean-Pierre Brans and Professor Bertrand Mareschal (Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, ULB Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles), including extensions such as GAIA.
The descriptive approach, named Gaia, allows the decision maker to visualize the main features of a decision problem:able to easily identify conflicts or synergies between criteria, to identify clusters of actions and to highlight remarkable performances.
The prescriptive approach, named Promethee provides the decision maker with both complete and partial rankings of the actions.

It has particular application in decision making, and is used around the world in a wide variety of decision scenarios, in fields such as business, governmental institutions, transportation, healthcare and education.
